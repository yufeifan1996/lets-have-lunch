# Let’s Have Lunch 

## Overview
👉🎥[Video Demo(presentation)](https://youtu.be/0B0Rbs729tk)
**Let’s Have Lunch** is a simple full-stack web application developed as my final project for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/). The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with how the **frontend**, **backend**, and **database** work together in a full-stack system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Understand the flow of data between frontend, backend, and database
- Practice building a full-stack web app from scratch
- Learn and apply React, Flask, and SQLite in a real-world scenario

---

## Project Description

**Let’s Have Lunch** is designed to help colleagues connect through casual lunch meetups.  
Users can:
- Create lunch invitations
- Browse upcoming lunch events
- Join or decline invitations
- View who’s attending

This simple concept aims to foster better communication, especially in multi-cultural and remote teams where casual bonding can be difficult.
